# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/fbba5e0d-9288-4b2c-bba4-e792bbc852f5

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Production process model

The Nixpacks production start command runs Next.js through PM2 cluster mode so the app can use multiple CPU cores on a single Coolify server. By default PM2 starts one worker per available CPU core; set `WEB_CONCURRENCY` to a number such as `2` or `4` if you want to cap the worker count.

- Native single-process start: `npm run start`
- Clustered production start: `npm run start:cluster`
